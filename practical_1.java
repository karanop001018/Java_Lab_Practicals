Q. Use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 X 2 system of linear
        equations for x and y:
        ax + by = e x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc)
        cx + dy = f y = (af - ec)/(ad -bc)
        Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the constants a,
        b, c, d, e, and f and the display the solution (x =?? and y =??). If
        ad-bc is 0, then your program prints â€œThe equation has no
        solution".
        Note: (1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 (2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9
